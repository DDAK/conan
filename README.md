# conan
This repo contains various Conan (http://conan.io) recipes that I have had to create for my work. Most of the recipes have been copied form ohers' work and adapted to my needs. I have attempted to give credit to the sources at all times, but if you do find some content that doesn't properly acknowledge the souce, I apologise in advance. I hope fellow coders find them useful.
