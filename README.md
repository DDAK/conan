# Conan
This repo contains various Conan (http://conan.io) recipes that I have had to create for my work. Most of the recipes have been copied form ohers' work and adapted to my needs. I have attempted to give credit to the sources at all times, but if you do find some content that doesn't properly acknowledge the souce, I apologise in advance. I hope fellow coders find them useful. 

Furthermore, I am quite possibly not an expert in Conan or Python, and fully understand that these artefacts are less than perfect. I'd welcome updates and changes that will make these artefacts better.

Cheers!
